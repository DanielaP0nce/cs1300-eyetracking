# cs1300-eyetracking

To analyze the eye tracking data that you have collected, you will generate a heatmap and a replay that depicts the areas where your participant's gaze was focused.

## STEPS:
1. Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/cs1300-2022/cs1300-eyetracking.git`
2. Copy or move your files from eye tracking into the folder (for each site version, there should be a CSV file and a screenshot)
